	<p>Angela Chitkara is Founder and CEO of US–India Corridor, a strategic communications and consulting practice connecting international companies to business opportunities in India and beyond.</p>
	<p> With an emphasis on creating mutually beneficial relationships, Angela helps clients develop dynamic, growth-oriented campaigns that integrate targeted media and public relations, in-depth market research, critical analysis, corporate social responsibility initiatives and crisis communication strategies to strengthen their brands’ global presence.</p>
	<p>As shifting international alignments give rise to economic and political interests that demand companies establish roots in new markets, the practice’s reach is extending beyond India’s borders, into other developing and emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.</p>
	<p>This interdisciplinary, culturally conscious approach attracts clients across industries and sectors, including biotechnology, law, entertainment, healthcare, private equity and clean/renewable energy. The firm is also involved with several pro bono projects, notably India-focused grass roots-level initiatives, and WEConnect International, a corporate-led non-profit dedicated to women’s business enterprise.</p>
	<p>A self-described “accidental entrepreneur,” Angela reported from international and local news desks in the United States, London, South Africa, Singapore and India, both fulfilling her childhood dream to be a foreign correspondent and refining the skills that have made her a sought-after business and media strategist today.</p>
	<p>Born in the US to Indian parents, Angela jokes that her journalism career was validated only after her father called Dell tech support and the India-based rep asked if the two were related. Globalization is alive and well.</p>
	<p>Angela holds a Masters in International Affairs from Columbia University and a Masters in International Journalism from City University in London, UK. She earned a BA in Communications from Seton Hall University, where she currently serves as an adjunct professor.</p>
