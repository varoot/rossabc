	<p> G. Mustafa Mohatarem has been General Motors’ Chief Economist since 1995, leading an economics team responsible for assessing the impact of worldwide economic developments on the world’s second largest automaker, and providing advice to the company in various competitive and economic policy issues.  This has been a period of major change in the global industry, when GM acquired major production capacity in Korea, developed a dominant market share in China even while requiring U.S. government support during the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession, and continues to expand its investments in Thailand, Indonesia and other fast-growing Asian markets.</p>
	<p>An expert on trade policy, Dr. Mohatarem led the GM Team responsible for advocating China's accession to WTO. He was also the lead executive from GM interacting with U.S. trade negotiators during the U.S.–Korea Free Trade Agreement negotiations.  Currently, his team is advising General Motors on the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, and other regional and international trade agreements.</p>
	<p>Dr. Mohatarem holds an MBA and a PhD in Economics from the University of Chicago, and has previously served as visiting assistant professor at the University of Notre Dame, and as adjunct assistant professor at the University of Michigan and the University of Detroit.</p>
	<p>His keynote speech will address the prospects for macroeconomic growth and rebalancing in individual Asian countries, including the impact of likely policy changes following recent elections in Japan and Korea, currency shifts and regulatory reforms, on manufacturing competitiveness, the auto industry, and intra-Asian and U.S.–Asian economic relations in the coming year.</p>
