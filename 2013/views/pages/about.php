<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>For the last 22 years, the Asia Business Conference has brought leaders of Asia and multinational companies together in Ann Arbor to discuss, debate, and dialogue about trends in the region. This year’s conference will again provide students and local professionals with a unique glimpse into the challenges and opportunities of doing business in Asia.</p>
<p>Last year’s conference featured more than 20 speakers from Asia and the United States and attracted nearly 300 business leaders, students, faculty and others interested in learning more about Asia. <strong>The program included regional panels on China, Japan, Korea, India, and ASEAN, as well as functional panels on Energy &amp; Environment, Technology, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).</strong>
</p>
<p>Past conferences have featured speakers from multinational corporations such as Google, Yahoo, Ford Motors, Logic Solutions, DoCoMo, Merrill Lynch, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mitsubishi Motors, General Motors, Shell, Nike, Satyam, Northwest Airlines, Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, Dow Chemical, Baxter Healthcare and Pfizer. Prominent government officials such as the Director of the World Bank, Indonesian ambassador to USA, ASEAN Secretary General, the Singapore Ambassador to the United Nations, the Finance Minister of India, Finance Minister of Thailand, and the United Nations Assistant Secretary General for Economic Development have given keynote addresses.</p>
<p>This is an excellent opportunity to <strong>network</strong> with political and business leaders from throughout the US and Asia, Michigan business students, and Ross alumni whilst also <strong>building a long-term relationship</strong> with the University of Michigan. Your participation provides our community with the unique opportunity to learn about how leaders, such as yourself, are shaping the future of Asia.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you at the 2013 Asia Business Conference!</p>
